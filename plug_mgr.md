    Oh My Zsh is a delightful, open source, community-driven framework for managing your Zsh configuration. It comes bundled with thousands of helpful functions, helpers, plugins, themes, and a few things that make you shout... "Oh My ZSH!"

  - [antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen)

    Antigen is a small set of functions that help you easily manage your shell (Zsh) plugins, called bundles. The concept is pretty much the same as bundles in a typical vim+pathogen setup. Antigen is to Zsh, what Vundle is to vim.
